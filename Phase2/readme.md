# LawVriksh â€” Assignment (Phase 2)

## What this is
A responsive React dashboard implementing UX improvements from Phase 1:
- Visual hierarchy (primary KPI)
- Quick Filters + advanced modal
- Worklist with optimistic UI
- Insights chart with transitions
- Accessibility (focus rings, ARIA where applicable)
- Motion using Framer Motion

## Tech
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion

## Run
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:5173`

## Notes
- Data is mocked. Network latency is simulated where needed to demo loading/optimistic UI.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
