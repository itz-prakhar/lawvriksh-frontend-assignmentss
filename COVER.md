This project delivers a **two‑phase frontend assignment** for LawVriksh, focused on creating a modern, usable, and motion‑enhanced dashboard for legal operations managers.

Phase 1 — UX & Motion Design (Research + Spec)
We analyzed user needs and applied **UX laws** (Hick’s, Fitts’s, Miller’s, Jakob’s, Doherty, Aesthetic‑Usability) to redesign the dashboard structure.  
Deliverables included:
- Clear **problem statement, personas, goals, and pain points**.  
- Annotated static dashboard design with hierarchy, grouping, accessibility callouts.  
- A **motion design plan** covering micro‑interactions, timing, easing, and guardrails.  
- Detailed **interaction states** (loading, empty, error, success) and responsive guidelines.  

This phase ensures design rationale before coding.

Phase 2 — Implementation (React + Tailwind + Motion)
We translated Phase 1 into code using **React, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion**.  
Deliverables included:
- Responsive **dashboard UI** with sidebar, header, KPI cards, filters, worklist, and insights.  
- **Micro‑interactions**: card hovers, row highlights, modals, toasts, optimistic updates.  
- **Accessible patterns** (focus rings, keyboard nav, ARIA roles).  
- Mock data with interactive cases, tasks, and filters.

Together, both phases demonstrate a **research‑driven design process** and a **polished, functional dashboard implementation**.
